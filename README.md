Collaborative Supply Chain Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on optimizing supply chain sustainability through data-driven decision-making. Using machine learning models and visual analytics, it identifies inefficiencies, predicts late delivery risks, and provides actionable insights to improve operations.

Key Features
Supply Chain Data Analysis: Examines sales, shipping trends, and customer behavior.
Predictive Modeling: Uses Random Forest Classifier to predict late deliveries with 97.4% accuracy.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies key factors affecting delays and sustainability.
Visualizations: Includes profit distribution, sales trends, shipping performance, and regional risk analysis.
Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Cleans, normalizes, and converts raw data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovers insights with visualizations.
Machine Learning Model: Trains a classification model for late delivery risk.
Results Interpretation: Uses feature importance and analytics to improve logistics.
